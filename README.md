#  ClimaApp

This is a weather app.
You'll be able to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually. 

Go to [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api) and use your own API KEY or create a new one to test the app
